Dojo Specific API Extensions
============================

A special ``rst`` processor is included with this wiki to handle some dojo_ documentation needs.

.. contents

API Links
---------

Include a link to the official API page for some passed function.

.. code ::

    .. api-link :: dojo.query

Will produce:

.. api-link :: dojo.query

This is done to eliminate the need to hardcode versions into links, or to manage the links yourself.

API Inline
----------

It is possible to inline the available API information from another page. 

.. code ::

   .. api-inline :: dojo.byId

Will produce:

.. api-inline :: dojo.byId

CodeGlass
---------

A special popup to control various JavaScript example is also included (maybe we should rewrite CodeGlass?).
