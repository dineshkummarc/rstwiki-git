Using CodeGlass
===============

.. contents ::

Actually want to rewrite codeglass. This is a test page from rst to ensure lots of options are available.

Basic Usage
-----------

Kick everything off with a ``.. code-example ::`` block

.. code-example ::

  .. js ::
 
    <script>
        alert("hi");
    </script>

This throws an exception before onload:

.. code-example ::

  .. js ::

     <script>var x = y</script>



That's all, folks.
